# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section

![Design preview for the Social proof section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## How to view this website
Open https://kensan73.github.io/frontend-mentor-social-proof-challenge/

Set your browser width to say 1440px or wider for desktop.


Set your browser width to 1439px or narrower for mobile.

I didn't use flexbox or grid, so this site does view correctly via IE11, and of course Chrome, Firefox, Edge.

## Bugs
~~I should eventually address centering content on desktop~~


Fixed my centering should be centered on desktop now.


Figma wasn't letting me copy / paste the different circled testimonials images besides the one.
